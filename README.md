# Tallboy
A drawer full of with Blade components built with Tailwind, AlpineJS, Laravel, and Livewire.

## Accessibility
Accessibility is hard to get right, but it's important. If you see something that could be improved, please let me know.
Components should be usable with a keyboard, and should be screen-reader friendly. Where possible, semantic HTML should
be used, and the browser/common HTML should be responsible for as much as it can be.

Contributions are welcome, but please note that this package is still in the early stages of development. You probably
shouldn't be using it yourself yet. If you do want to contribute, please feel free to open a PR. Please don't request

if components that can be used and customised.
